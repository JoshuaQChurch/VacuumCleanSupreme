### Description
In the game mode *Protect the queen*, one of the 3 bunnies is assigned the status *Queen*.  
The queen can not place traps, but the other 2 bunnies can with the traps having a 10 second lifespwn.  
If the round ends and the queen is still alive, the bunnies won.  
The Vacuum wins if it consumes the queen before the time limit.  
The other 2 bunnies have a 10 second respawn if eaten, and will slow down the vacuum for 5 seconds when consumed.  
A battery is spawned randomly in the scene with every bunny consumption, and 1 every 15 seconds, with an additional 2 at the 45 second mark.  
Batteries recover 50% charge of the Vacuum
